        "####Introduction:\n",
        "A shopping mall (or simply mall) is a North American term for a large indoor shopping center, usually anchored by department stores. The term \"mall\" originally meant a pedestrian promenade with shops along it (that is, the term was used to refer to the walkway itself), but in the late 1960s, it began to be used as a generic term for the large enclosed shopping centers that were becoming commonplace at the time. In the U.K., such complexes are considered shopping centers, though \"shopping center\" covers many more sizes and types of centers than the North American \"mall\". Other countries may follow U.S. usage (India,U.A.E., etc.) and others (Australia,Canada etc.) follow U.K. usage.\n",
